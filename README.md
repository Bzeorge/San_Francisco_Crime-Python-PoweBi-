# San_Francisco_Crime-Python-PowerBi-
Have you ever thought about which day is the best to visit San Francisco or which places you should avoid? Well, San Francisco Police Department published a database of crime reports for the last 5 years, containing more than 700.000 rows and 27 columns.
<br>In this project, I will use Python to explore, clean, and prepare the dataset for visualization in Power Bi.


## Main questions:
**1) Which day of the week is the safest?** <br>

**2) Which place is better to avoid?**

**NOTE:** The code I published is the clean version of the original one. In the original code, I double-checked the data frame after each step, made some extra steps, etc.
