# San_Francisco_Crime-Python-PowerBi-
Have you ever thought about which day is the best to visit San Francisco or which places you should avoid? Well, San Francisco Police Department published a database of crime reports for the last 5 years, containing more than 700.000 rows and 27 columns.
<br>In this project, I will use Python to explore, clean, and prepare the dataset for visualization in Power Bi.


## Main questions:
**1) Which day of the week is the safest?** <br>

**2) Which place is better to avoid?**

**NOTE:** The code I published is the clean version of the original one. In the original code, I double-checked the data frame after each step, made some extra steps, etc.



### Get the data ready for visualization <br>
![step1](https://github.com/Bzeorge/San_Francisco_Crime-Python-PowerBi-/assets/74241688/405b46d4-d704-4226-a446-aba6efe52cc5)<br>
Here we can see that some columns contain null values - missing values. And because I want to plot the data on a map later, I need to make sure that there arenÂ´t any missing values for Lattitude and Longitude column

To remove null values I used dropna() function for the Latitude column

After removing null values, the dataset size decreased by approximately 40.000 rows

The dataset contains too many columns which are not important to this project, so I selected only the columns I will use

And here comes the tricky part! Each crime has a date and time but from the logic, the crime which happened on Sunday at 3 am still belongs to Saturday night, I had to transform the Incident Datetime column to datetime object, create a new column with shifted time by 6 hours and a new day in the week column from the shifted time

Finally, I saved the new data frame as a csv file for further analysis in Power Bi
